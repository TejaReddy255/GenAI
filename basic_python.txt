Basic of python 

Identifiers:names of entites 
    eg:class, variables, fuction
rules
  letters lower case 0-9 digits and underscore can be used 
  keywords cannot be used as Identifiers
  cannot start with digit 
  cannot use special symbols like%,$,&,

Keywords:reserved words to define synatax and  structure of  python
rules 
  they are case sentive
  True, False,None,try

indentation:each line  of  code must be indented

suite: lines of  code starting with header line in control statement
it ends with:

block: lines of code in functions
snippet: a small portion of code

follow clear consie and compact  coding
    indentation
    use blank lines for distiguishing code blocks
    use # to write comment
    use triple qoutes to multiple comment """xxx"""
    use docstring """xxx""" to explain scripts,fuctions and classes
    for effiecent coding and code reuse use classes

Data type: classification of  data( string,integers, floats and boolean).
     define the operation of data  and  structure of storing the data
 

primitive data type - integer, string, floats boolean
non primitive types-array, list set, dictionary

control statements: if, elif and else

list compherension- tool used to filtering out and transforming(mapping)

generator : use to generator set of values can be used only ones
  
lambda, expression map and zip function

filter is a built in function and also a generator
    higher order function taking function as a parameter
    it takes one argument with function it returns true  when condition met

lambda
 it has no syntax
 it takes multiple arguments but have only one expression
 lambda x:x+1

map it is used mapping new value to existing value


High order function
  -lexical scope
  -map
  -filter
  -fold
  -lambda (Anonymous function)

functions
  parameters
    postional arguments # should follow order as postional to keyword
    keyword arguments
    mixed arguments
    default arguments

packing and unpacking
it helps to work with iterables

dictionary


nested function

closure
   free variables
