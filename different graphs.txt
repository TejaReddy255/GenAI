Two dimentional data vizualization
Scatter Plot: Plots two variables against each other to see relationships or patterns.
Heatmap: Displays data in matrix form with color gradients, useful for visualizing correlation matrices or intensity patterns.
Line Plot: Can show relationships between two variables over time.
Contour Plot: Used for showing 3D data projections (on 2D planes).
Bubble Chart: Like a scatter plot, but with an additional dimension represented by the size of the bubbles.

multiple dimentional data vizualization
Pair Plot (Scatterplot Matrix):

A pair plot or scatterplot matrix visualizes relationships between multiple numerical variables. It shows scatter plots for each pair of variables, allowing you to see how they interact with one another.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Plot:

PCA is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining as much variance as possible. You can use PCA to reduce multivariate data to two or three dimensions for visualization.
Parallel Coordinates Plot:

This plot allows the visualization of multivariate data where each axis represents one feature, and each line represents a data point. Itâ€™s especially useful for comparing high-dimensional data.
Heatmap with Multiple Variables:

In cases where you have data in a matrix or grid format (such as correlations or similarities), a heatmap is an excellent way to represent multidimensional relationships.
Bubble Chart:

Similar to scatter plots, but it adds a third dimension by varying the size of the points (bubbles). This is useful when you want to represent three or more dimensions in a 2D plot.
Radial or Spider (Radar) Chart:

A radar chart can represent multidimensional data where each axis represents one dimension. This is often used in product comparisons or performance metrics.
3D Scatter Plot:

If you have three dimensions, a 3D scatter plot can be used to plot the data in a three-dimensional space. For more than three dimensions, dimensionality reduction techniques (like PCA) are helpful to bring down the dimensions to 3D.
